## Approach

1. Virtual environment
   
    Each developer has their preferences in choosing tools to 
    define a virtual environment, for this implementation I 
    opted to use pipenv which uses Pipfile instead of requirements.txt, 
    however a requirements.txt file will be provided to facilitate 
    other developers to use this Implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. Libraries
   
   As described in the Pipfile and requirements.txt files, 
   the libraries needed to run this implementation are:

    * django==4.0.2
    * djangorestframework==3.13.1
    * drf-yasg==1.20.0

## How to use

1. Build the images by running
    ```
    $ docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
2. Make the migrations
   The implementation comes with the app api migration done, the dev just needs to "migrate"
   ```
   $ docker-compose exec hotel_web python manage.py migrate
   ``` 
3. Create a super user
   ```
   $ docker-compose exec hotel_web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
